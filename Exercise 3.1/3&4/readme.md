    <h2>block cipher</h2>
    <p>This is the first paragraph. It contains a long description about various aspects of the webpage and its design. Designing web pages involves multiple elements including layout, structure, typography, and user experience. This paragraph demonstrates how the text styling, colors, and fonts work together to create a visually appealing and readable interface. Moreover, using external CSS allows for cleaner and more maintainable code by separating the content from the presentation. The universal selector in CSS helps ensure consistency across all elements, making the design more predictable and user-friendly. Additionally, the use of web fonts, such as Roboto, improves the appearance of the text, making it modern and easy to read. Overall, the design and implementation of a well-structured web page contribute to both the aesthetic and functional aspects of the web, ultimately creating a better user experience for visitors. Whether it's for personal use or business purposes, ensuring that a website is accessible, responsive, and visually coherent is essential in today’s web-driven world.</p>

    <h2>AES</h2>
    <p>This is the second paragraph. The styling will apply to all paragraphs on this page.Hello, world! My name is Jen. I live in Boston. Minneapolis is awesome. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quisquam nostrum, ea consequatur quae impedit sunt cupiditate amet at saepe nulla consequuntur tenetur, repellendus commodi voluptates molestiae deserunt fugit? Consequuntur odit rem magni, veritatis distinctio unde. Tempore ad expedita fugit suscipit.</p>

    <h2>DES</h2>
    <p>This is the third paragraph. Notice the consistency of the styles applied through external CSS.   The requirements of the field are well within the capabilities of even the beginner in photography, viz.; the ability to make good negatives and good prints, the ability to recognise news-value, and a methodical plan to find the market where the prints will find acceptance. The man or woman who can meet these requirements should be fairly successful from the beginning, and will open up quickly new avenues of special work and profit."
        In short, the ability to make metaphors or create lovely heroines is not necessary for successfully selling photographs to publications.
        Is the field overcrowded? <em>No</em>. If there were ten times as many persons engaged in the work, they could all keep themselves busy.
        The field—how wide is it? Get out your map of the world. The field for <em>making</em> photographs extends from the top margin to the bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for <em>selling</em> photographs—which is more to the point—extends over about five thousand publications that use prints; not to speak of a few score of other markets.</p></p>
